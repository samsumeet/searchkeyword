# searchkeyword

1. Its a Spring Boot Project. You can generate Executable Jar by executing `mvn install`.

2. `Algorithm`: Every time user search some keyword it will store that keyword as well the frquency in map and at same time generate a score that is calculated with respect to other keyword searched frequency. After that it sorts the collection on basis of score and return last 10.

3. Actually order is insignificant because there score will be almost similar.

4. Solution is quite accurate. I have done testing on Jmeter.
